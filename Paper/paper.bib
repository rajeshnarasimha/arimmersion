	Abstract = { This paper presents a set of interactive tools designed to give users virtual x-ray vision. These tools address a common problem in depicting occluded infrastructure: either too much information is displayed, confusing users, or too little information is displayed, depriving users of important depth cues. Four tools are presented: the tunnel tool and room selector tool directly augment the user's view of the environment, allowing them to explore the scene in direct, first person view. The room in miniature tool allows the user to select and interact with a room from a third person perspective, allowing users to view the contents of the room from points of view that would normally be difficult or impossible to achieve. The room slicer tool aids users in exploring volumetric data displayed within the room in miniature tool. Used together, the tools presented in this paper can be used to achieve the virtual x-ray vision effect. We test our prototype system in a far-field mobile augmented reality setup, visualizing the interiors of a small set of buildings on the UCSB campus.},

	Abstract = {We propose the use of virtual environments to simulate augmented reality (AR) systems for the purposes of experimentation and usability evaluation. This method allows complete control in the AR environment, providing many advantages over testing with true AR systems. We also discuss some of the limitations to the simulation approach. We have demonstrated the use of such a simulation in a proof of concept experiment controlling the levels of registration error in the AR scenario. In this experiment, we used the simulation method to investigate the effects of registration error on task performance for a generic task involving precise motor control for AR object manipulation. Isolating jitter and latency errors, we provide empirical evidence of the relationship between accurate registration and task performance.},

	Abstract = {We conducted a user study of the effect of registration error on performance of tracking distant objects in augmented reality. Categorizing error by types that are often used as specifications, we hoped to derive some insight into the ability of users to tolerate noise, latency, and orientation error. We used measurements from actual systems to derive the parameter settings. We expected all three errors to influence userspsila ability to perform the task correctly and the precision with which they performed the task. We found that high latency had a negative impact on both performance and response time. While noise consistently interacted with the other variables, and orientation error increased user error, the differences between ldquohighrdquo and ldquolowrdquo amounts were smaller than we expected. Results of userspsila subjective rankings of these three categories of error were surprisingly mixed. Users believed noise was the most detrimental, though statistical analysis of performance refuted this belief. We interpret the results and draw insights for system design.},
